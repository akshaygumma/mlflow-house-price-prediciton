# 🏠 House Price Prediction using MLflow

This project demonstrates how to use MLflow for experiment tracking and model management in a **House Price Prediction** machine learning pipeline.

## 🔍 Overview

Using a regression model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or Linear Regression), this project aims to:
- Predict house prices based on input features
- Log all hyperparameters and metrics using **MLflow**
- Compare multiple runs visually in the **MLflow UI**
- Register the best-performing model

## 📌 Goals

1. 🔄 Run hyperparameter tuning during model training
2. 📈 Log hyperparameters, metrics, and models to MLflow
3. 📊 Compare different runs via the MLflow UI
4. ✅ Register the best-performing run as a model

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
